# About this project
This project is a simple CRUD application created using java servlets. It runs on Java SE-17 and requires an application server, such as [Apache Tomcat® 10.x](https://tomcat.apache.org/download-10.cgi)

# How do I build this project?
You can easily build the code directly from within your IDE of choice (I'm personally rather fond of [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/)) 

First of all, you'll need an application server. For this guide, I'll assume you've installed Apache Tomcat® (for a guide on doing so, please refer to Apache Tomcat®'s get started guide).

you have to import this project to your IDE and run it on the server.
Once you run this project on the server it will open in a web browser. available [here](http://localhost:8080/WorldInfoCrud/)
